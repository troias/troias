# My Development Preferences

## Overview
Hey there! I'm a front-end developer who primarily codes using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) 💻. My favorite plugin for VS Code is GitHub Copilot ✨, which greatly enhances my coding experience.

## Tech Stack
When it comes to front-end development, I predominantly use TypeScript (TS) 🚀 and TSX 🌟 to code front ends in React ⚛️. TypeScript's static typing brings additional safety and efficiency to my development process. React, being a powerful library, allows me to build dynamic user interfaces easily.

## Favorite Framework
Among the frameworks available for React development, my personal favorite is Next.js 📦. It provides server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and simple routing, enabling me to build fast and scalable applications. Next.js has become my go-to framework due to its excellent developer experience and optimization features.

## Career Focus
At 31 years old, I'm actively seeking opportunities as a front-end developer. With my expertise in front-end technologies, including TypeScript, React, and Next.js, I'm confident in my ability to contribute to innovative and engaging projects. I strive to collaborate with dynamic teams and contribute to creating exceptional user experiences.

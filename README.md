# /About me

## Overview
Hey there! I'm a front-end developer who primarily codes using **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** ![vscode](https://github.com/troias/troias/assets/26407409/a2a30d7f-fcd7-4868-a52a-68e02970e601). My favorite plugin for VS Code is **GitHub Copilot** ![copilot-24](https://github.com/troias/troias/assets/26407409/ed984da7-1f16-4ed4-95ef-fd761a0e139e) which greatly enhances my coding experience.

## Tech Stack
When it comes to front-end development, I predominantly use **TypeScript (TS)** ![icons8-typescript-20](https://github.com/troias/troias/assets/26407409/98add89e-29e5-4fb9-b9d6-184332678ce7)
   and TSX ![tsx (1)](https://github.com/troias/troias/assets/26407409/89146f7b-808c-4e0f-bf3e-153fe459bbbf)
 to code front ends in React ![react](https://github.com/troias/troias/assets/26407409/c01a52af-3d0a-420d-b444-37bdfed29dc4). TypeScript's static typing brings additional safety and efficiency to my development process. React, being a powerful library, allows me to build dynamic user interfaces easily.

## Favorite Framework
Among the frameworks available for React development, my personal favorite is **Next.js** ![nextjs-icon](https://github.com/troias/troias/assets/26407409/07e9e518-88ef-4f7f-945d-a53c79e11b54)
. It provides server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and simple routing, enabling me to build fast and scalable applications. Next.js has become my go-to framework due to its excellent developer experience and optimization features.

## Styling
For styling purposes, I mainly use **TailwindCSS** [tailwindcss (1)](https://github.com/troias/troias/assets/26407409/05096712-459a-4ba9-a3c4-36168c707b5f)
  at the moment. TailwindCSS offers a utility-first approach, which allows me to rapidly build and customize responsive designs. Its extensive set of pre-built components and responsive classes significantly speeds up my development process and enhances maintainability.

## Design
When it comes to image manipulation, I rely on **GIMP** ![gimp](https://github.com/troias/troias/assets/26407409/46924f3a-df3a-49ba-8842-452a978d3430)
. It's a powerful open-source software that provides a wide range of tools for editing and enhancing images. For creating logos and vector graphics, I prefer **Inkscape** ![inkscape](https://github.com/troias/troias/assets/26407409/b65dc42a-4843-498c-aa20-3c16a46defe9)
, which offers a versatile set of features and excellent support for scalable vector graphics (SVG). And for overall design work, including wireframing and prototyping, I use **Figma** ![figma](https://github.com/troias/troias/assets/26407409/781db4b3-ebe1-416c-8d1f-2f3d80ff0c88)
. Figma's collaborative features and intuitive interface make it an ideal choice for design projects.

## Current Project-1: Ecommerce Store
I'm currently working on an ecommerce store using Next.js, TailwindUI ecommerce components, and the Shopify API ![shopify](https://github.com/troias/troias/assets/26407409/01e9f6b7-7578-4819-bc7c-906ad8fcebeb)
. This project allows me to leverage the power of Next.js for server-side rendering and efficient routing. I utilize TailwindUI ecommerce components to create a sleek and responsive user interface. Integrating with the Shopify API enables seamless product management, cart functionality, and secure payment processing. I'm excited about building a fully functional and user-friendly ecommerce solution.

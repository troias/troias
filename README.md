# My Development Preferences

## Overview
Hey there! I'm a front-end developer who primarily codes using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) üíª. My favorite plugin for VS Code is GitHub Copilot ![github-copilot](https://github.com/troias/troias/assets/26407409/69556ed4-69e2-49a8-8b92-37c322d88627)
, which greatly enhances my coding experience.

## Tech Stack
When it comes to front-end development, I predominantly use TypeScript (TS)![icons8-typescript-20](https://github.com/troias/troias/assets/26407409/98add89e-29e5-4fb9-b9d6-184332678ce7)
   and TSX ![tsx](https://github.com/troias/troias/assets/26407409/e4762bd3-3dab-4503-be03-2153903234ed) to code front ends in React ![react](https://github.com/troias/troias/assets/26407409/c01a52af-3d0a-420d-b444-37bdfed29dc4). TypeScript's static typing brings additional safety and efficiency to my development process. React, being a powerful library, allows me to build dynamic user interfaces easily.

## Styling
For styling purposes, I mainly use **TailwindCSS** üé® at the moment. TailwindCSS offers a utility-first approach, which allows me to rapidly build and customize responsive designs. Its extensive set of pre-built components and responsive classes significantly speeds up my development process and enhances maintainability.

## Design
When it comes to image manipulation, I rely on **GIMP** üñåÔ∏è. It's a powerful open-source software that provides a wide range of tools for editing and enhancing images. For creating logos and vector graphics, I prefer **Inkscape** ‚úíÔ∏è, which offers a versatile set of features and excellent support for scalable vector graphics (SVG). And for overall design work, including wireframing and prototyping, I use **Figma** üé®. Figma's collaborative features and intuitive interface make it an ideal choice for design projects.

## Current Project-1: Ecommerce Store
I'm currently working on an ecommerce store using Next.js, TailwindUI ecommerce components, and the Shopify API. This project allows me to leverage the power of Next.js for server-side rendering and efficient routing. I utilize TailwindUI ecommerce components to create a sleek and responsive user interface. Integrating with the Shopify API enables seamless product management, cart functionality, and secure payment processing. I'm excited about building a fully functional and user-friendly ecommerce solution.

## Current Project-2: Shopify Agency with Shopify Hydrogen
I'm currently working on a Shopify agency, specializing in creating customized online stores for clients. Our agency utilizes Shopify Hydrogen to build stunning and high-performance ecommerce websites. Shopify Hydrogen allows us to leverage the power of Shopify's infrastructure while providing flexibility and customization options. It enables us to create unique and tailored experiences for our clients, meeting their specific business requirements.

## Current Project-3: Portfolio and Blog
In addition to client work, I'm also working on developing my portfolio website, where I showcase my previous projects and share insightful articles on front-end development. This portfolio serves as a platform to demonstrate my skills and expertise to potential clients and employers. Additionally, by maintaining a blog, I aim to contribute to the developer community by sharing my knowledge and experiences with others.


## Favorite Framework
Among the frameworks available for React development, my personal favorite is Next.js üì¶. It provides server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and simple routing, enabling me to build fast and scalable applications. Next.js has become my go-to framework due to its excellent developer experience and optimization features.

## Career Focus
At 31 years old, I'm actively seeking opportunities as a front-end developer. With my expertise in front-end technologies, including TypeScript, React, and Next.js, I'm confident in my ability to contribute to innovative and engaging projects. I strive to collaborate with dynamic teams and contribute to creating exceptional user experiences.
